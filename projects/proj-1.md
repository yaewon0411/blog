title: 'AI service detecting whether safety equipment is worn at construction sites'
---
- team member : yaewon-An, yuhyang-Hong

Since the number of construction site accidents does not decrease, 
the project was implemented with the aim of improving workers' fundamental safety 
awareness through artificial intelligence programs. This project was carried out using YOLO v3 
for object recognition only for classes that need to be identified at the construction site. 
Currently, the object list includes people, trucks, safety helmets, and safety vests, 
which will be updated later. It can be used as a recognition program where wearing safety equipment is mandatory. 
If there is a visible difference in the accident rate depending on the use of the recognition program at the site, 
statistics based on this are expected to improve related system maintenance and on-site safety awareness as a mandatory requirement
