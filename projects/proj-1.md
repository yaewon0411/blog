title: 'AI service detecting whether safety equipment is worn at construction sites'
---

According to the number of construction site accidents does not decrease, 
the project was carried out with the aim of improving workers' fundamental safety awareness 
through artificial intelligence programs.
This project was implemented using YOLO v3, and objects are recognized only for classes to be classified at the construction site. Currently, there are people, trucks, safety helmets, and safety vests on the object list, which will be updated later.
It can be used as a recognition program where wearing safety equipment is mandatory. If the difference in the accident rate depending on the use of the recognition program is visible at the site, statistics based on this are expected to improve related system maintenance and on-site safety awareness for mandatory.
