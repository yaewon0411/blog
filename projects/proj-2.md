---
 This project aims to provide simple and efficient services through a computerized unmanned courier integrated management
system in place where space and cost burden are incurred to install unmanned delivery boxes.
The application function is largely composed of a notification system and a management system.
The notification system provides a notification informing the recipient that there is a courier to receive.
The management system provides management functions for receiving and returning packages and is used by all recipients, couriers, and agents. 
 In addition, it provides a function to prevent incorrect receipt through a face capture system.
