This is a service that aims to provide convenience to users who utilize airports. 
It offers functionalities such as itinerary management, onboarding day weather, 
airport congestion and travel time, parking information, and more, all based on flight ticket information.
To obtain the necessary data, we utilize OPEN APIs. We parse the JSON data corresponding to the user's input 
flight ticket information from various APIs, including the Korea Meteorological 
Administration's Short-term Forecast API, Very Short-term Forecast API, Aircraft Operation Information API, 
Airport Travel Time API, and Airport Congestion API. The parsed data is processed and prepared for use on the frontend,
allowing us to implement real-time data utilization and provide users with accurate and reliable information.
